I promise to never use my provte key associated with real money in plain text.

1. For the moment, a `$PRIVATE_KEY` in my `.env` file is cool (So long as the `.env` file is not exposed).
2. But for real money, DO NOT DO THAT!!!! Use `--interactive` or a keystore file with a password once foundry adds that.
